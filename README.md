# Final Submission for Data Journalism at UvA
As part of my final project for the Data Journalism course, I analysed results from a World Bank survey about the economic shocks faced by the rural areas of six Indian states in order to find patterns or trends that would make for an interesting journalistic story. This GitHub repository is to provide readers with access to the steps I've taken during the process of writing the article. The final article can be found on [this link.](https://shettyapeksha.medium.com/world-bank-study-reveals-impact-of-covid-19-on-household-expenses-in-india-d3ddde0ec723)
